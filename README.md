### Colter Frank and Gregg Ryan's Code For Build Attack Defend (BAD) Project CI470 Aviation Cybersecurity at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University


This python code is ready to be executed using a Python shell on Windows 11, video functionality does not work on Ubuntu 20.04 but operation does, beyond that it is untested. 

Required dependencies: cv2 (for video), djitellopy (for operating drone), datetime (for timestamping the video that is output), and threading (to allow for live video feed and recording at the same time)

Code to install dependencies:

```pip3 install cv2```

```pip3 install djitellopy```

```pip3 install datetime```

```pip3 install threading```
